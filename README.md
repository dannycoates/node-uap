## node-uap
This repository is a wrap-up of https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core and https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-ref-impl

#### Why?
At the moment `uap-ref-impl` repository contains only reference implementation without data required to use the parser and the `uap-core` repository isn't published to npm registry.
